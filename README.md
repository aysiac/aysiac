About Me
Hello there! I'm Aysiac, and I'm thrilled to have you visit my GitHub profile. I'm a passionate developer and an avid learner who is always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow.

ðŸ”­ Currently Working On
m currently working on a project called "Child Development Tracker," a Web Application developed using Java and Spring. The main goal of this application is to track child developmental milestones, providing parents and caregivers with a useful tool to monitor their children's progress.

Key Features:
Secure PostgreSQL Database: I engineered a PostgreSQL database to ensure the safety and privacy of child-related data and medical records.

Enriching with External APIs: The application is integrated with external APIs that offer valuable resources and information related to child development.

User Authorization and Authentication: To maintain data security, I implemented user authorization and authentication mechanisms, allowing only authorized users to access and modify the data.

I'm enthusiastic about this project as it combines my technical skills with my passion for child development. The Child Development Tracker has the potential to make a positive impact on families and caregivers by providing valuable insights into their children's growth.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to improve and refine the application. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome as I work towards making this project even more valuable and user-friendly.

ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
I'm currently focusing on obtaining certifications in three key areas:

Cybersecurity: I'm actively pursuing certifications that will enhance my knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. Learning about threat detection, risk management, and implementing secure practices are among my primary objectives.

AWS (Amazon Web Services): As cloud computing becomes increasingly vital in modern technology, I am dedicating time to gaining certifications in AWS. Understanding cloud infrastructure, deployment, and management will be valuable assets in my future projects.

Project Management: I'm also engaged in acquiring project management certifications. These certifications will help me improve my ability to plan, execute, and lead successful projects, ensuring efficient outcomes and client satisfaction.

As I continue my journey to acquire these certifications, I'm eager to apply the knowledge gained to real-world scenarios and contribute to the ever-evolving fields of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and project management.
